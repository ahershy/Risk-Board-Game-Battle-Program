# Risk Board Game Battle Program
I'm building a Risk battle calculator to help me learn python. For context as to what Risk is and how battling works, check out this article: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-math-to-win-at-the-board-game-risk-2013-7?IR=T

My vision:

*To have only 2 inputs: attacking army and defending army.

*To output the summary of how many armies were killed on each side and to declare who won: attacker or defender.

*Output a log of all the dice rolls for each iteration that happened along the way. So you can see how the battle went in detail afterwards.

*Graph the data
